#LWW AduioGlossary

Spanish and English version for the audioglossary. Audioglossary 


Also features which we need to show case apart from current features:
The audio glossary would support English-Spanish bilingual students, and the implementation of this glossary would be determined by the budgetary and content constraints for each individual title.
"Impelsys - when the User clicks on the Term from eBook, then the Audio Glossary engine will launch. Later, the user can toggle between English & Spanish Terms. We don't need to explicitly understand whether they clicked on English or Spanish Term.
Meredith - Yes, that's correct. Not all titles have Spanish Terms. Hence, if it is ONLY English then Spanish will not show up."

Audio terms can be up to 130 characters long, and may be comprised of more than 1 term (ie: Appendicular skeleton) or hyphenated terms.

Proper nouns should be capitalized, but content is going to be provided as it should appear – there shouldn’t be any changing of case that happens once content is handed off to go into the engine.

"WKH will provide the Phonetic Pronunciation for each term. Later, this will be incorporated"
